West Gate of Itchan Kala;41.378687078482, 60.357067897317854;"The West Gate of Itchan Kala, also known as Ata Darvoza (""Father Gate""), serves as the main and most majestic entrance to Khiva’s ancient inner city — a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This imposing gate was historically the official ceremonial entry point to the city and continues to welcome visitors into one of Central Asia’s best-preserved medieval urban ensembles.

Originally destroyed in the early 20th century, the West Gate was faithfully reconstructed in the 1970s, restoring its symmetrical brick towers and arched vaults in line with traditional Khivan design. Standing before it, travelers are met with the iconic view of Kalta Minor Minaret and Muhammad Amin Khan Madrasah, marking the beginning of an unforgettable journey through centuries of Islamic culture and architecture.

In the past, Ata Darvoza was used for royal processions, official delegations, and grand ceremonies. Its strategic location allowed for direct access to the central square and major monuments within the citadel. Today, it remains the most popular entry point for tourists and a powerful symbol of Khiva’s legacy.

Passing through the West Gate is a step back in time, into a world of minarets, madrasahs, and legends from the golden age of the Silk Road."
Kalta Minor Minaret;41.378408787023766, 60.3578690683491;"The Kalta Minor Minaret is one of the most iconic landmarks of Khiva. Even though it was never completed, its unique look makes it very special. The beautiful turquoise and blue tiles shine under the sunlight and stand out among the sandy colors of the old city.
You cannot climb inside, but just seeing it from the outside is impressive enough. It’s located right in the center of Itchan Kala, so you will definitely pass by it many times during your visit. At night, when the lights are on, it looks even more magical.
The minaret is also connected to the Muhammad Amin Khan Madrasah through a wooden passage, which adds even more charm to the place."
